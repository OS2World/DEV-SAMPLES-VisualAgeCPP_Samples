populate table records from DAX classes to the ICollectionViewListBox.

The sample consists of 2 parts, a visual part (strgen) and a non-visual part (Customer)

TASKs:

1) build Customer non-visual part:
   - see Customer non-visual part from strgen.vbb for more details.
   - save&generate part-source.

2) build strgen visual part:
   - see strgen visual part from strgen.vbb for more details
   - save&generate part-source
   - save&generate main for part
   - declare and define the nested class for IStringGenerator, see strgen.hpv and
      strgen.cpv more details.

3) build the target:
